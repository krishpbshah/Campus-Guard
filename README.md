Safety App for Female Students at the University of Western Ontario
Project Overview
This repository contains the collaborative efforts of a six-member team dedicated to developing a safety app for female students at the University of Western Ontario. The primary goal of the app is to enhance the safety and security of its users on the university campus through innovative features, including GPS tracking for real-time location sharing with campus security and a built-in chat feature.

Key Features
GPS Tracking: Real-time location sharing with campus security ensures that users can quickly receive assistance in case of emergencies.

Built-in Chat Feature: The app includes a chat feature to facilitate communication between users and security personnel, fostering a more responsive and supportive environment.
